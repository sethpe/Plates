# Plates

## Workout tracking and health dashboard

Plates has two functions, tracking health data (steps and heart rate) and letting the user manually create their own workout. 

Integration of both the HealthKit API and Core Data allow for flexibility and eventually an expanded feature set, potentially including diets, video references for workouts, cloud storage, and more.
